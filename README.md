# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews
A machine learning project for sentiment analysis on movie reviews. It classifies reviews as positive or negative using models like logistic regression and SVM. The pipeline includes data collection (e.g., IMDb), text preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using accuracy and F1-score. Useful for understanding audience sentiment and supporting data-driven decisions in film and review platforms.
